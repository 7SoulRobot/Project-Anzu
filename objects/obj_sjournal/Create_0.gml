/// @description Hi Heidi!
// This is a journal of my game design progress and thoughts before I complete my secret plan ;)

/*
	I started over making our game today. It had been so long since I worked on our game
and Gamemaker 2 came out recently. So I figured it would be good to start from scratch. 
I also had the idea to make this journal about my thoughts and my game design process.
It's also to tell you how much I love and how happy I am that you are going to be
working together with me on this project. <3

	I coded some basic movement today and made some placeholder sprites. I'm so excited about
working with you on our project! I love you to pieces sweetheart!

- Love, Andrew
*/

/*
	It's been too long since I last worked on the game. I'm feeling kind of sad about it. 
We're always so busy with other things. I wish this could be our full-time jobs. 
Maybe someday. Anyways no time to dwell on the past I should get to work.

	I added basic collisions today, and I put some basic shelves into the room for testing
purposes. I love you so much Boobah! You mean the world to me!

- Love, Andrew

/*
	Wow! I'm actually doing work two days in a row! I'm so proud of myself... 
I'm not really sure what to do next. Sorry I'm not very good at this journaling thing.
Of course I know you'll probably love it anyways, but I still worry about it for some reason.
I think I will work on making the collisions more precise today.

	That's exactly what I did! Go me! Pixel perfect collisions check! I love you Heidicakes!

	Soooo it's been a long time again. :( Aaaaannnnddd I just realized I haven't been
dating these... sigh. I really wish I had. Oh well, guess I can start now. It's 8/16/17 today.
Yeeeaaaahhhh. So I procrastinated a lot. I was supposed to have everything ready by the 19th
of this month. I don't really know what I'm going to do now. To be fair we have both
been really really busy this summer. We had planned to get so much done on the game. :(
Well... I have the rest of this week. I just need to be positive and do the best that
I can.

	Today was spent pretty much just refamiliarizing myself with my own code, but then
I also went and made it better and more efficient. I feel like I somehow improved even when
I wasn't actively working on our game. That's encouraging! I wish this journal had been more
positive overall, but I can't help how I felt in the past. I feel really positive and
super pumped right now though! I can't wait to get more done tomorrow! Oh there was one other
thing I did. I added a secret room! By the time you are reading this you will know exactly
what room I'm talking about. ;) <3

	I love you soooooooo much I don't think I could ever put it into words! But, I try to 
every day anyway! I love you more than anything Heidi!

- Love, Andrew

	Woohoo go me! I'm actually doing it! I was excited and I stayed excited! I'm really
anxious about you reading this, but I'm also excited! I'm starting to really feel like we can
do this! I don't have much time for journaling this though. I better get to work!

	Today I made the movement system smoother. I added acceleration and friction. To make
the movement feel better. I really like how it's turning out. I'm starting to feel more
confident about programming. I can't wait to see how our game will turn out!

	Later today I also added vision cones and made it so they detect the player! AND when
they do they turn red! I'm just really excited about this addition because it's the first
thing that is ENTIRELY my own code that I came up with! It's a big step for me and I feel
really happy right now!

	You are the best and most adorablest person in the world Boobah and I love you more
than you will ever know!

- Love, Andrew

	Just today and tomorrow left. I'm not quite sure where to start today. I asked you 
yesterday if it would be ok to delay things a couple days. You seemed more confused than
anything else so it will probably be ok haha. <3 Maaaaaaybe I will work on enemy movement
today? Idk though. You just walked by with a sleeping cat in your arms! You're adorable!
I'm gonna procrastinate a little bit now while I think about what to do next.

	I decided to make the player move in a jiggly kind of way because he reminds me of
a cube of jello and also it's adorable! I love you more than jello!

- Love, Andrew

	Happy 11 year anniversary!!! We went to the fair today so I don't think I'll get much
work done today, but I wanted to let you know how much I love you anyway! *It's a lot!*
Oh! I'll write down the ideas we had for in game bus ads! That's what I'll do! I can't
wait to watch Boku no Hero, but you're making me wait anyways! Guh! ANYWAYS... I love you!

- Love, Andrew

/* 8/20/17
	I'm really exhausted from going to the fair yesterday, but I got a lot done anyways!
Today I added basic enemy movement like I had planned to do 2 days ago. For now they
just move towards the player, but later I'll make it so they move along paths or randomly.
I'm probably going to do more today, but it's time for a break. Tomorrow is the big day
after all! Of course you don't know that though. ;)

	Later I made it so they move randomly, that was fast. I'm really excited about tomorrow.
I wonder if you know it's happening tomorrow? Let's hope not! I love you more than
anything in the entire multiverse! Even more than alternate version of you! Haha now I'm
just being weird because I'm tired. We have to wake up early in the morning. I better
stop typing because you are done brushing your teeth now. I love you!

- Love, Andrew
